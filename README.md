# **Economic Data Analysis Using Python** üßÆ

## **Overview** üìä
This project focuses on analyzing **unemployment rates** and **labor force participation rates** across the 52 states in the USA. Data was sourced from the FRED website (Federal Reserve Economic Data) using web scraping techniques. The analysis includes time series data manipulation, visualization, and exploration of the relationship between unemployment rates and labor force participation rates.

## **Data Source** üìÖ
- The data was scraped from the [FRED Website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), a government website that provides a wealth of economic data.
- The data consists of two tables:
  - **Unemployment Rate**: Columns represent 52 states across the USA.
  - **Labor Force Participation Rate**: Columns represent 52 states across the USA.

## **Objectives** üèÜ
- **Visualize Time Series Data**: Plot graphs to observe trends over time.
- **Explore Relationships**: Identify potential correlations between the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate across states.
- **Plot Individual and Comparative Graphs**: Create bar plots, line plots, and scatter plots for better understanding.

## **Key Features** ‚ú®
- **Time Series Data Analysis**: Visualizing economic indicators over time.
- **Web Scraping**: Automated data collection from the FRED website.

## **Technologies Used** üíª
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
  - **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup, Requests
  - **Time Series Analysis**: Pandas, Statsmodels

## **Conclusion** üéØ

Economic crises have consistently led to sharp rises in **unemployment rates** and declines in **labor force participation rates**. Notable examples include:

- **2008 Financial Crisis**: Unemployment surged, especially in **New York**, due to the collapse of financial institutions.
- **2020 COVID-19 Pandemic**: The crisis caused widespread job losses and a significant drop in labor participation across the U.S Especially in Manufacturing led States.
- **2001 IT Bubble Crisis**: **California** was most affected due to its reliance on the tech industry, leading to a spike in unemployment.
- **War Periods**: Fluctuations were also seen during war times, though less severe than financial crises.

This analysis highlights the consistent relationship between major economic disruptions and employment trends, with states like **California** and **New York** being most impacted during tech and financial crises, respectively.
